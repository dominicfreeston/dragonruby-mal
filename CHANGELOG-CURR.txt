* 5.0
** [IMPORTANT] This release has minor breaking changes. They are trivial to resolve.
   Come to the DragonRuby Discord Server and we'll help you work through any issues.
   [[http://discord.dragonruby.org]].

   Let's start with some good news before we get into breaking changes.
** [Support] Portrait orientation enabled for all license tiers.
   In ~metadata/game_metadata.txt~, you can set ~orientation=portrait~ and DragonRuby will
   be presented with a logical resolution of 720x1280.
*** Limitations/Differences between license tiers.
    - The Standard and Indie tier's portrait resolution is fixed to 720p (with scaling).
    - You will still need a Pro license to:
      - Render your game in HD and High DPI.
      - Leverage auto-discovery of Texture Atlases (Pro tier supports resolutions
        from 720p all the way to 4K).
      - Deploy your portrait (or landscape) game to a mobile device, AppStore, or Google Play.
      - Render outside of the game's safe area (All Screen Mode).

    I hope the ability to prototype a portrait game encourages y'all to upgrade to Pro
    so you can play the games you've built on your phone (even potentially release to the AppStore and Google Play).

    Okay, now for the breaking changes (don't panic).
** [BREAKING] ~Outputs#sounds~ no longer supports looping audio. Migrate to ~Args#audio~.
   If you were passing ~.ogg~ values into ~args.outputs.sounds~, they will no longer loop.
   All sounds passed into this collection will play once. Example:

   #+begin_src
     def tick args
       if args.state.tick_count == 0
         # bg music will not loop after completion
         # use args.audio to create a looping (see below)
         args.outputs.sounds << "sounds/bg-music.ogg"
       end
     end
   #+end_src

   If you want audio to loop, use ~args.audio~:

   #+begin_src
     def tick args
       if args.state.tick_count == 0
         args.audio[:bg_music] = { input: "sounds/bg-music.ogg", looping: true }
       end
     end
   #+end_src

   A warning message will be provided by DrangonRuby if we detect this breaking change.
** [BREAKING] Property based access in ~Hash#(x|x1|y|y1)~ no longer consults ~rect~, ~point~.
   The following behavior of ~Hash#(x|x1|y|y1)~ was experimental and has been removed
   (it's unlikely that you even used this/knew about it).

   This is the ~Hash~ behavior in 4.x:

   #+begin_src
     some_hash = {
       rect: {
         x: 0,
	 y: 0,
	 w: 100,
	 h: 100
       }
     }

     puts some_hash.x      # -> 0
     puts some_hash.x1     # -> 0
     puts some_hash.rect.x # -> 0
   #+end_src

   This is the ~Hash~ behavior in 5.0:

   #+begin_src
     some_hash = {
       rect: {
         x: 0,
	 y: 0,
	 w: 100,
	 h: 100
       }
     }

     puts some_hash.x      # -> nil
     puts some_hash.x1     # -> nil
     puts some_hash.rect.x # -> 0
   #+end_src

   Keep an eye out for null reference exceptions and check to see if
   you have a nested ~Hash~ with ~rect~ or ~point~ defined.

   That's it for breaking changes.
** [Pro] [iOS] Device type can now be specified when deploying to the simulator.
   ~$wizards.ios.start~ now supports a ~:sim_name~ argument. If you don't provide one, your
   game will be deployed to an iPhone 14 Simulator. Example:
   #+begin_src
     # this command is run in DragonRuby's Console
     $wizards.ios.start env: :sim, sim_name: "iPad Pro (12.9-inch)"
   #+end_src

   To get available simulators, you can run the following command in a terminal window:
   #+begin_src
     # run this command in a terminal window (not DragonRuby's Console)
     xcrun simctl list devices
   #+end_src

   A thank you goes out to death.au@discord for adding this capability.
** [Performance] Performance of property based access of ~Hash~ values improved by ~30%.
   Expect to see a small improvement if you use attribute accessors to access
   ~Hash~ values (eg ~some_hash.x~ vs ~some_hash[:x]~).
** [Support] Framerate notification made less obtrusive and can be disabled.
   The FPS warning messages have been modified to not show a wall of text in the console. You
   can toggle the warning message using ~$gtk.(disable|enable)_framerate_warning!~. It is enabled
   by default and will provide instructions on how to disable the warning in case you forget
   this method name.
** [Bugfix] Fixed segfault of http apis if an invalid URL is passed to the function.
   A thank you goes out to thedarkmagi@discord for finding unique was of crashing
   DragonRuby.
** [Bugfix] ~$gtk.reset_and_replay FILE_NAME, speed: SPEED~ no longer ignores the ~speed:~ parameter.
** [Bugfix] Invocation of ~$gtk.calcstringbox~ no longer crashes web builds.
** [Docs] Added more comprehensive docs for ~args.audio~ and fixed code examples for ~gtk.http_post~.
** [OSS] ~attr_gtk~ implementation uses predictable ~iVar~ names.
   A number of people got tripped up in using ~attr_gtk~ because of the ~@__PROP__~ naming
   convention. The naming convention has been changed to the more easily guessable ~@PROP~ format.
** [mRuby] Small performance improvements to ~mrb_obj_value~ have been made.
   The function is used frequently in the virtual machine, so it was worth making a small change
   to this runtime machinery.
** [Note] My sincerest condolences to anyone upset about not having a DR version number of 4.20.
* 4.19
** [Pro] [iOS] Fixed iOS wizard's simulator deployment.
** [Performance] Small performance improvement to value retrieval of ~Hash~ via ~method_missing~.
** [Docs] Docs added/refined for creating a new DR project and deploying/publishing.
** [Bugfix] Web games no longer crash on Safari.
   Note: There is a bug in how Itch.io serves up the COOP COEP headers which needs to be fixed
   before web games will work with Safari (opening up an issue with Itch pending).
* 4.18
** [Pro] C Extensions has access to more mRuby functions.
   You now have access to ~300 mRuby functions. For usage example, see the sample located at
   =samples/12_c_extensions/04_handcrafted_extension_advanced=

   Let us know if there's a function you'd like added that we haven't exposed.
** [Bugfix] ~Module#purge_class~ takes into consideration the module context as opposed to ~Object~.
   This function is useful if you want to reinitialize a class without functions that may have been
   added via hotloading but no longer exist in source code.
** [Docs] New doc pages have been added.
   - Both Docs and Samples are located at =index.(html|txt)=
   - Just Docs are located at =docs.(html|txt)=
   - Just Samples are located at =samples.(html|txt)=
   - Open Sourced files are located at =oss.txt=

   The pages above are located locally within the =./docs= directory and online at [[docs.dragonruby.org]]

   Note:
   This change breaks permalinks to samples. If you have them referenced anywhere, you'll need to update them. :sadpanda:
* 4.17
** [Bugfix] Fixed file persistence accross sessions for webbuilds.
** [Performance] Added caching of symbols used in C (minor performance improvement in load times).
* 4.16
** [Pro] [iOS] Http apis have been re-introduced.
   Http apis have be re-enabled and use standard iOS apis as opposed
   to libcurl. With this change, TestFlight builds will be accepted by
   Apple.
*** IMPORTANT:
    Apple requires all http requests to be over https and will not allow http
    requests to unencrypted urls in production packages (they are allowed in
    dev builds however).
** [Pro] [iOS] Simulator support added.
   You can now run your game with hotloading directly on the simulator. From the
   Console run ~$wizards.ios.start env: :sim~ to do so.
** [Performance] Web builds now use Emscripten multi-threaded capabilities.
   Expect to see performance improvements for web builds with this change.
*** IMPORTANT:
    Web builds now require the use of SharedArrayBuffer which will require you to
    enable the ~SharedArrayBuffer~ support on Itch.io. An error message will be presented
    on your game if we detect that this property has not been set correctly.

    If you are self-hosting your game, your web server must include the COOP and COEP HTTP
    Headers for your game to work. More info here: [[https://web.dev/coop-coep/]].

    Additionally, because of these headers, you will not be able to issue HTTP requests
    within a web build that are Cross Origin.
** [Support] ~Added $gtk.disable_controller_config!~
   DR presents a wizard for unrecognized controllers. If you want to disable this wizard,
   you can use this function to do so.
** [Performance] Label rendering performance improved.
   Expect to see a performance improvement of over 100% for labels rendered as Hashes, Entities, and Classes.
** [Support] ~$gtk.reset~ also resets sprites.
   If you do not want to reset sprites, you can do ~$gtk.reset include_sprites: false~
** [Support] Current DragonRuby version and changelog can be viewed at [[version.dragonruby.org]] and [[changelog.dragonruby.org]].
* 4.15
** [Bug] Removed mouse wheel debug statements.
** [Bug] Fixed regression where ~args.inputs.mouse.click~ no longer returned true for middle and right mouse buttons.
** [Support] Added ~args.inputs.keyboard.active~ and ~args.inputs.controller.active~.
   This property will return true if any of keys or buttons were pressed on the frame. It's useful
   for instructions contextually to which input device the player is using.
* 4.14
** [Pro] [iOS] Fixed iOS binaries so that they will be accepted by TestFlight.
   We have temporarily disabled $gtk.http_* apis until we isolate what part of that machinery
   is causing the binary to be rejected by TestFlight (instead of waiting for Apple to fix the bug
   on their end).
** [Pro] [iOS] Fixed scaling issue for games running on the iPhone 13 mini.
** [Support] ~$gtk.platform~ returns "Steam Deck" if the game is being run on the Steam Deck.
** [Bugfix] Removed mouse wheel debug statements.
** [Docs] Added docs for deploying to a local Steam Deck.
* 4.13
** [Indie] [Pro] [Support] Beta release of Steam distribution.
   ~dragonruby-publish~ now supports the creation of a Steam package containing Linux, Mac, and Windows
   binaries of your game. A "Deploying to Steam" section has been added to documentation (which is available
   locally at http://localhost:9001 while DragonRuby is running, and online at docs.dragonruby.org).

   This is a beta iteration with some rough edges. Let us know if you hit any snags and we'll improve
   on what's there.

   This enhancement to ~dragonruby-publish~ streamlines should prove to be a significant time
   saver over creating payload using the Steamworks toolchain :-)
** [Bugfix] Pixel arrays are now fully unlocked in the Standard license tier. I swear it'll work this time.
** [Performance] Increased the polling interval between simulation ticks for web builds.
   The faster interval helped top end machines, but taxed lower end machines a bit too much. Frame rates
   will be more stable, but a little lower.
** [Bugfix] Mouse wheel input will now be captured during game play recording.
* 4.12
** [Bugfix] Fixed Raspberry Pi and Web Builds.
   Tweetcart updates had an unintended side effect and broke Raspberry Pi and Web. Regression suites
   have been put into place to make sure this doesn't happen again. We are unsure of why only those platforms
   failed, but think it's a bug in mRuby's byte-code compilation (further research needed).

   The Tweetcart source has been mostly reverted except for the addition of the ~pixels!~ and ~color~
   method. We will work with OSS contributers to flesh out a fuller api (and get closer to finding the
   mRuby bug).
* 4.11
** [Support] $args.pixel_arrays unlocked for all license tiers!
   All license tiers can now use both sound synthesis and pixel arrays, woo hoo!
** [OSS] Tweetcart apis enhanced given that everyone can now use pixel arrays.
   Source code for tweetcart.rb is available locally at =./docs/oss.txt= and
   online at https://github.com/DragonRuby/dragonruby-game-toolkit-contrib/blob/main/dragon/tweetcart.rb.

   You can download the GitHub version by invoking the following function in the DragonRuby Console:

   $gtk.download_stb_rb "dragonruby", "dragonruby-game-toolkit-contrib", "tweetcart.rb"

** [Support] A "Close Console" button is available in a production build.
   It's helpful to have this button if you're running the game on a touch device w/o a keyboard.
** [Bugfix] render_targets will no longer be randomly lost on Windows+DirectX when the game window is resized.
   No really. This time we definitely maybe have this resolved.
** [Performance] Performance improvements to web builds.
   Invocation of ~tick~ should happen more frequently bringing web games closer to 60fps.
* 4.10
** [Samples] Added sample app that shows how to orchestrate a sequence of animations (eg cutscenes).
   Sample app location: =./samples/08_tweening_lerping_easing_functions/08_cutscenes=
** [Samples] Added sample app/reference implementation for a casual arcade game.
   Sample app location: =samples/99_genre_arcade/squares=
** [Samples] Added sample that show's how to create an animated button.
   Sample app location: =./samples/08_tweening_lerping_easing_functions/04_pulsing_button=
** [Samples] Added sample app that shows how to do drag and drop (leverages ~$args.inputs.mouse.held~).
   Sample app location: =./samples/02_input_basics/04_mouse_drag_and_drop=
** [Bugfix] dragonruby-publish ignores unrecognized files as opposed to failing (such as .DS_Store).
** [Bugfix] dragonruby-publish gives a better error message if game icons are too large.
** [Bugfix] render_targets will no longer be randomly lost on Windows+DirectX when the game window is resized.
   NOTE: There was a lot of rewiring of outputs and render targets behind the scenes. Please bring up
   issues on the DragonRuby Discord Server's feedback-bug-report channel: https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/895482347250655292
** [Support] ~args.outputs.background_color~ now accepts both colors in Hash and Array format.
** [Support] Added ~$gtk.reset_sprites "DIRECTORY"~.
   Function will recursively go through the the directory provided and reset
   all pngs/invalidate DR cached textures.
** [OSS] Open sourced =./runtime/async_require.rb=.
   Source code is under =./docs/oss.txt=
** [Support] Added ~$gtk.download_stb_rb~ and ~$gtk.download_stb_rb_raw~.
   These two functions can help facilitate the integration of external code files. OSS contributors
   are encouraged to create libraries that all fit in one file (lowering the barrier to
   entry for adoption).

   Examples:

   #+begin_src
     def tick args
     end

     # option 1:
     # source code will be downloaded from the specified GitHub url, and saved locally with a
     # predefined folder convension.
     $gtk.download_stb_rb "https://github.com/xenobrain/ruby_vectormath/blob/main/vectormath_2d.rb"

     # option 2:
     # source code will be downloaded from the specified GitHub username, repository, and file.
     # code will be saved locally with a predefined folder convension.
     $gtk.download_stb_rb "xenobrain", "ruby_vectormath", "vectormath_2d.rb"

     # option 3:
     # source code will be downloaded from a direct/raw url and saved to a direct/raw local path.
     $gtk.download_stb_rb_raw "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenobrain/ruby_vectormath/main/vectormath_2d.rb",
                              "lib/xenobrain/ruby_vectionmath/vectormath_2d.rb"
   #+end_src
* 4.9
** [Support] ~anchor_x~, ~anchor_y~ has been added to labels, borders, and solids.
   For labels the following lines are equivalent:
   #+begin_src
     def tick args
       args.outputs.labels << {
         x: 640,
	 y: 360,
	 text: "Hello World",
	 alignment_enum: 1,
	 vertical_alignment_enum: 1
       }

       args.outputs.labels << {
         x: 640,
	 y: 360,
	 text: "Hello World",
	 anchor_x: 0.5,
	 anchor_y: 0.5
       }
     end
   #+end

   If ~alignment~ keys and ~anchor~ keys are both provided, the ~anchor~ keys
   will be given precedence (their default value is ~nil~).

   Borders and solids behave like sprites (see notes about ~anchor~ attributes in 4.8 change log).
** [Support] ~args.geometry.intersect_rect?~ and ~args.geometry.inside_rect?~ respect ~anchor_x~ and ~anchor_y~.
   Given the addition of the ~anchor~ properties to rect-based primitives, these geometry functions
   have been updated to take the new properties into consideration when determining collision.

   A special thank you to @Ceph@discord and @Dominic@dicord for making a valid case
   for adding this functionality through the use of a sample app that ships with DR.
** [Support] ~$gtk.set_window_scale(float_value)~ has been added.
   This is a helper method that will resize your game window to a scaled 16:9 (or 9:16 for portrait mode) aspect ratio.

   The float value that is passed into the method will be floored to the closest supported scale:
   0.1 (160x90), 0.25 (320p), 0.5 (540p), 0.75 (960p), 1.0 (720p), 1.25 (HD+), 1.5 (1080p), 2.0 (1440p), 2.5 (1800p), 3.0 (4k), 4.0 (5k)

   Note: This method does not change the logical resolution of 1280x720 (it just resizes your game window).
** [Support] Added ~args.inputs.mouse.held~
   This method compliments ~args.inputs.mouse.(click|down)~ and ~args.inputs.mouse.up~ (about damn time).
** [Samples] Animation states sample app has been updated to leverage the new ~anchor_x~, ~anchor_y~ properties.
   Sample app location: =./samples/03_rendering_sprites/03_animation_states=
** [Samples] Clepto Frog sample app has been rewritten/significantly cleaned up.
   The Clepto Frog platformer reference implementation has been cleaned up significantly.
   The reference implementation covers the following concepts in a non-trivial way:
   - Rendering a camera viewport with pan and zoom using render targets.
   - Saving and loading game data from the file system.
   - In-game map editor.
   - Physics and AABB collision.
** [Samples] Added sample app that covers ~args.layout.rect~ apis in landscape mode.
   Originally this sample app was only written for portrait mode and was only available to
   Pro users.
   Sample app location: =./samples/07_advanced_rendering/18_layouts=

   Note: ~args.layout.rect~ is an extremely valuable bit of machinery when it comes to laying out
   menu systems and ui elements (definitely worth getting familiar with).
** [Samples] Added sample app that shows how to convert from camera space to world space using matrices.
   Sample app location: =./samples/07_advanced_rendering/16_matrix_camera_space_world_space=
** [Bugfix] Minor typo fixes/elaborations added to the docs. Minor updates to purchase matrix on dragonruby.org and itch.io.
* 4.8
** [Bugfix] [Pro] [Android] ~dragonruby-publish~ generates apks and aab's that are compatible with SDK 33+.
** [Support] Replay speed for recordings can be as high as 60x (increased from 7x).
** [Support] ~anchor_x~ and ~anchor_y~ added to Sprites.
   The default value for ~anchor_x~ and ~anchor_y~ is ~nil~. Setting the value to (for example) 0.5, 0.5
   will shift the x left by 50% of the width and y down by 50% of the height.

   Example:
   #+begin_src
     def tick args
       # sprite's bottom left corner will be at 640, 360
       args.outputs.sprites << { x: 640, y: 360, w: 30, h: 30, path: "sprites/square/blue.png" }

       # sprite's bottom left corner will be at 625, 345 (sprite's center will be at 640, 360)
       args.outputs.sprites << { x: 640, y: 360, anchor_x: 0.5, anchor_y: 0.5, w: 30, h: 30, path: "sprites/square/blue.png" }

       # sprite's bottom left corner will be at 625, 360 (sprite is centered on the x axis, and bottom aligned on the y axis)
       args.outputs.sprites << { x: 640, y: 360, anchor_x: 0.5, anchor_y: 0, w: 30, h: 30, path: "sprites/square/blue.png" }
     end
   #+end_src
*** Advanced sprite rendering.
    If you are using classes with ~draw_override~. The ~ffi_draw.draw_sprite_5~ function is available to use:

    The argument order for ffi_draw.draw_sprite_5 is:
    - x, y, w, h,
    - path,
    - angle,
    - alpha, red_saturation, green_saturation, blue_saturation
    - tile_x, tile_y, tile_w, tile_h,
    - flip_horizontally, flip_vertically,
    - angle_anchor_x, angle_anchor_y,
    - source_x, source_y, source_w, source_h,
    - blendmode_enum
    - anchor_x
    - anchor_y

    See =./samples/09_performance/07_static_sprites_as_classes_with_custom_drawing= how to use ~draw_override~.
** [Support] ~size_px~ added to Labels.
   A label's size can be provided via ~size_enum~ or ~size_px~. If both are provided ~size_px~ will
   be used (the default value of ~size_px~ is nil).
   #+begin_src
     def tick args
       # render a label in the center of the screen with a pixel
       # height of 22 pixels
       args.outputs.labels << { x: 360,
                                y: 640,
				text: "Hello World."
				size_px: 22,
				alignment_enum: 1,
				vertical_alignment_enum: 1 }
     end
   #+end_src
** [Samples] Added sample app that shows how to create a camera with multiple targets
   Sample located at: =./samples/07_advanced_rendering/07_simple_camera_multiple_targets=
** [Samples] Added sample app that shows how to do raycasting with textures and projectiles.
   Sample located at: =./samples/99_genre_3d/04_ray_caster_advanced=

   A HUGE thank you to James (@68K@discord) for contributing this sample app and giving
   us a solid starting point for creating a game like Doom.
** [Bugfix] Numeric functions in docs are now categorized correctly.
** [Support] [Pro] Web builds can now be published with HD and High DPI enabled.
** [Support] Added ~args.inputs.key_up.char~
   The property which will be the character that was just released
   (similar to how ~args.inputs.key_down.char~ represents the
   character that was just pressed)
** [OSS] Open sourced the machinery that controls the processing of
   --no-tick and --tick cli arguments under =./runtime/process_argv.rb=
** [Support] [Advanced] Added ~$gtk.disable_nil_punning!~.
   Nil punning in DR allows you to do the following:

   #+begin_src
     def tick args
       args.state.player.loc.x ||= 100
       args.state.player.armor.hp ||= 500
     end
   #+end_src

   While the above syntax provides convenience while rapidly prototyping, it can lead to null
   reference exceptions that are harder to track down as your project becomes more complex (and is
   now less needed given that ~Hash~ can access ~key/value~ pairs as if they were attributes).
   You can use ~$gtk.disable_nil_punning!~ to disable this capability. Doing so will require you
   to specify the intermediary properties before you can set a value on leaf attributes.

   Example:

   #+begin_src
     def tick args
       # the following lines will throw an exception if nil punning is disabled
       # args.state.player.loc.x ||= 100
       # args.state.player.armor.hp ||= 500

       # instead, you must do

       # option 1
       # fully define state using hashes
       args.state.player ||= {
         loc: {
	   x: 100
	 },
	 armor: {
	   hp: 500
	 }
       }

       # OR

       # option 2
       # fully define state using entities
       args.state.player ||= args.state.new_entity(:player)
       args.state.player.loc ||= args.state.new_entity(:loc)
       args.state.player.loc.x ||= 100
       args.state.player.armor ||= args.state.new_entity(:armor, hp: 500)
     end

     # disabling nil punning must be done outside of tick
     $gtk.disable_nil_punning!
   #+end_src
* 4.7
** [Support] Sound Synthesis is now available at all license tiers, including Standard! Woo hoo!
   Check out the sample app located at: =./samples/07_advanced_audio/02_sound_synthesis/=
** [Samples] Sample app added that shows how to make a Fifteen Puzzle game.
   Location of sample app: =./samples/99_genre_board_game/01_fifteen_puzzle=
** [Bugfix] Standard definition rendering of labels was inaccurate for size_enum and window scales > 1280x720. This has been fixed.
** [Bugfix] Documentation export escapes ruby code that would be interpreted as html.
* 4.6
** [Bugfix] Screenshot api ignores alpha transparency if ~a~ is 255.
** [Bugfix] ~set_mouse_grab(2)~ fixed to behave correctly (it was definitely Ryan's fault).
** [OSS] Open sourced ~$gtk.notify~ machinery.
   Source code for ~GTK::Runtime::Notify~ in =./docs/oss.txt=.
** [OSS] Open sourced ~$gtk.process_argsv~
   Source code for ~GTK::Runtime::ProcessARGSV~ in =./docs/oss.txt=.
** [OSS] Updated the following docs based on feedback in #oss-docs-contributions:

** [Samples] Sample app added that shows how to create a checkbox.
   Location of sample: =samples/09_ui_controls/01_checkboxes=
** [Samples] Sample app added that shows how create a button + label using a render_target.
   Location of sample: =samples/07_advanced_rendering/06_buttons_as_render_targets=
** [Samples] Sample app added that shows how to create an animation queue.
   An animation queue is useful for visual effects such as a particle system.
   Location of sample: =samples/08_tweening_lerping_easing_functions/06_animation_queues=
** [Samples] Added sample app that shows how to do a very simple AABB collision.
   Location of sample: =./samples/04_physics_and_collisions/01_simple_aabb_collision_with_map_editor=
** [Samples] Added sample app that shows how to do a AABB collisions with a built in map editor.
   Location of sample: =./samples/04_physics_and_collisions/01_simple_aabb_collision=
** [Samples] Added sample app that shows how to create a render target composed of multiple sprites.
   Location of sample: =./samples/07_advanced_rendering/01_render_targets_combining_sprites=
** [Samples] Added sample app that shows ramp collision.
   This sample app uses the new replay capabilities ~$gtk.replay_and_reset "replay.txt", speed: 2~. A replay
   file is included with the sample so you can see how changing parts of the code affects collision.
   Location of sample: =samples/04_physics_and_collisions/12_ramp_collision=
** [Support] Added ~args.state.geometry.find_all_intersect_rect(rect, rects)~
   Similar to ~args.state.geometry.find_intersect_rect~ but returns a collection opposed to just the first collision. This function is implemented in C.
** [Support] Major enhancements to recording and replay functionality.
*** ~$recording.on_replay_tick &block~ and ~$recording.on_recording_tick &block~ functions:
    These functions can be used to execute code while a recording or replay is executing.

    Example:

    #+begin_src
      def tick args
        ....
      end

      $recording.on_replay_tick do |args|
        # code will be called after each tick of a replay
      end

      $recording.on_recording_tick do |args|
        # code will be called after each tick of a recording
      end
    #+end_src
*** ~$gtk.reset_and_replay FILE, speed: (1 - 7)
    Calling this function at the bottom of a file (outside of tick) will automatically reset your game and run the replay.

    Example:

    #+begin_src
      def tick args
        ....
      end

      # record a replay via the Console by using the menu item or running ~$record.start_recording SEED_NUMBER~.
      # after your recording has been saved, you can use the following line to autoplay the recording
      # on file save
      $gtk.reset_and_replay "replay.txt", speed: 2
    #+end_src
*** ~$recording.start_replay~ accepts a ~speed:~ parameter.
    From the console you can run ~$recording.start_replay FILE, speed: 2~. The maximum replay speed is ~7~.

** [Samples] Sample app that shows advanced scene transitions (with global fade-in and fade-out)
   Location of sample: =./samples/08_tweening_lerping_easing_functions/05_scene_transitions=
** [Support] Added docs for ~args.gtk~ functions.
** [Support] Added docs for ~args.geometry~ functions.
** [Support] Added ~Numeric#lerp(to, step)~ and ~Numeric#remap(r1_begin, r1_end, r2_begin, r2_end)~.
** [Support] Added Easing definitions ~smooth_start_(quad|cube|quart|quint)~ and ~smooth_stop_(quad|cube|quart|quint)~
   Example:

   #+begin_src
    def tick args
      args.state.box ||= {
        x: 0,
        y: 0,
        w: 40,
        h: 40
      }

      final_x = 1240
      final_y = 680

      # if space key is pressed, start animation
      if args.inputs.keyboard.key_down.space
        args.state.animation_start_at = args.state.tick_count
      end

      progress_x = 0
      progress_y = 0

      if args.state.animation_start_at
        perc = args.easing.ease args.state.animation_start_at,     # start tick
                                args.state.tick_count,             # current tick
                                60,                                # duration
                                :smooth_stop_quint                 # easing definition

        progress_x = final_x * perc
        progress_y = final_y * perc
      end

      args.outputs.solids << {
        x: progress_x,
        y: progress_y,
        w: 40,
        h: 40
      }
    end
   #+end_src
* 4.4
** [Bugfix] Triangle rendering of solids respects r,g,b values.
* 4.3
** [Bugfix] Simpler encoding of a game's web-build working directory.
* 4.2
** [Bugfix] Update to web-based builds to remove offset within the Itch.io iFrame. This is definitely maybe fixed this time.
** [Bugfix] Ensure that a game's web-build working directory is unique from game to game.
* 4.1
** [Bugfix] Update to web-based builds to remove offset within the Itch.io iFrame.
* 4.0
** [BREAKING] This release contains two very minor breaking changes (don't panic).
   1. ~args.inputs.mouse.point~ no longer returns a ~Tuple/Array~ and
      instead returns a ~Hash~ with ~x~ and ~y~ keys.

      NOTE: You will ONLY see an issue with this change if you were
      destructing the ~Tuple~.

      Lines like the following:

      #+begin_src ruby
        # destructure tuple no longer supported
        x, y = args.inputs.mouse.point
      #+end_src

      Must be changed to:

      #+begin_src ruby
        # Hash is returned (which cannot be destructured)
        point = args.inputs.mouse.point
        x, y = point.x, point.y
      #+end_src

   2. ~args.inputs.directional_vector~ has a similar change and can no longer
       be destructured.

   That's it for the breaking changes!
** [Pro] [iOS] C Extensions fixed so that they are accepted by TestFlight.
   A sample app has been added that shows how to package C Extensions for iOS:
   =/samples/12_c_extensions/05_ios_c_extensions/=
** [Pro] [Android] Android SDK target is now version 33 (android-ndk-r25b).
** [Bugfix] [Pro] ~all_screen_max_scale~ in combination with ~highdpi~ is respected for both
   landscape and portrait games.
** [Samples] Turn based RPG sample app has been added.
   The sample app is located at: =./samples/99_genre_rpg_turn_based/turn_based_battle=.
** [Performance] Performance improvements to ~Entities~.
   Both ~args.state.new_entity~ and ~args.state.new_entity_strict~
   have gotten some performance improvements. The perf boost to
   ~new_entity_strict~ is significant.
** [Performance] [Support] ~args.gtk.warn_array_primitives!~ added.
   While array based primitives are simple to create, they come with a performance
   penalty. If you find that you're having performance issues, you can use ~warn_array_primitives~
   to find places in your code where array primitives are used/created
   (so you can convert them to ~Hashes~):

   #+begin_src ruby
     def tick args
       # add this line to the top of your tick method
       args.gtk.warn_array_primitives!

       # a log entry will be printed to the Console anywhere array primitives are being used

       # example
       args.outputs.labels << [100, 100, "Hello"]

       # example
       rect_1 = [10, 100, 50, 50]
       rect_2 = [10, 100, 50, 50]
       args.geometry.intersect_rect? rect_1, rect_2
     end
   #+end_src
** [Support] Added out of bounds warning for sprite's ~(source|tile)_(x|y|w|h)~ properties.
   You will be warned if a specified source/tile rect goes past the boundaries of a sprite.
